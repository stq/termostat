# termostat
arduino termostat for incubator or 3d printer

#features
* maintain temperature by switching on/off heater relay
* adjust goal temperature by resistor
* adjust average temperature recalculation time by resistor (0-90 sec, 60-90s is recommended for 1 turn resistor, 10-20s for multiturn resistor)
* adjust hysteresis (0-9.9 celsius, 6.0c is reccomended for most temperature sensors)

#hardware

1 arduino nano

1 arduino-ready relay

1 ceramic heater with fan, installed in incubator or 3d printer

2 small resistors 10k

1 potentiometer 10k, multiturn is prefferable

1 lcd 16x2
